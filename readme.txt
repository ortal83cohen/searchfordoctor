*Android Coding Task

Please implement the story below. The code will be used as a basis of discussion on the
next step of the interview with the current Android developers.
There is also other stuff like login, but just keep it to the bare minimum (in the sense that you
can get an access token, and username password is hardcoded).


*Acceptance Criteria

? After logging in, there should be a search bar in which I can do a text search of
doctors. The doctor should be considerable nearby. If I am in Berlin, there should
be no doctor in München. (This should be taken care by the api already.)

? I should get the result in a list, which shows me the name of the doctor, the
address, and the photo of the place (if exist)
? As I scroll to the bottom, more results should be added until there are no more
results left

*Ignored

UI/UX, session management, tests etc'
